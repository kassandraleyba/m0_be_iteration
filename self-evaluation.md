# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
    - Somewhat confident. I'm going to spend some time over the week reviewing and trying new methods.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - I experienced productive struggle. I knew I needed to use an if statement and length method, but had to trial and error with placement in the code block. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    Yes, I'd like to work on medium to difficult exercises until I become more comfortable.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - I'm going to use resources from Turing and google to work on exercises and answer any questions I have that may come up during the process.
